        <h2>My Favourite Movie - Spotlight </h2>

        <p>
         My favourite movie of 2016 is 'Spotlight', which recently won two
        awards from Oscar as the "Best Motion Picture of the Year" and
        the "Best writing, Original Screenplay". 
        </p>
        <p> This movie is absolutely stunning and inspiring mainly 
        because of its storyline. It illustrates a true story of
        how the Boston Globe reveal the scandal of child molestation
        that covered up by local Catholic Archdiocese. Spotlight, a special
        team within Boston Globe, trace down this scandal until they hold
        evidences to prove that child molestation has existed throughout
        a long period and across different states in America, or even in
        the globe. When a movie can reveal a real issue, it is powerful
        enough without any special visual effects or Hollywood's a-list cast. 
        (Source:<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895587/?ref_=ttawd_awd_tt">IMDB-"Spotlight"</a>) </p>
        
        <p> 
        Nevertheless,the movie is worth watching also because of the great 
        performances delivered by theses actors and actress. They are Mark Ruffalo,
        Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and so on. The whole crews display the real-life
        of journalists in print media and makes the story convincible.</p>

<p> As a Chinese-born student studied in media, I amaze about that how
American journalists bravely uncover social issues and systematic problems. Also,
after watching this movie I cannot stop questioning about the differences between the news  in digital media and the news in print media. As we can browse massive information online,
should we still pay for news to keep the valuable news alive?

	       <h3>Applied CSS3 techniques</h3>
	       <p>In this homework, I also learn two other CSS3 techniques: 
	       <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">
	       Radial Gradients</a>
	       and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_text_effects.asp">CSS text effect </a>.</p>
	       <p>
	       As this 'aside-box' display, I discover that I can put at least two colors
	       to create a radial gradients effect for the background.This techniques 
	       currently can be displayed by almost every updated browsers including 
	       Chrome, Operas, Safaris and Firefox, no vendor-prefixing required. 
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       For text effect, I discover "text-overflow" property specifies how overflowed content can be hidden or displayed.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       For example:Hover over the sentence below, to see the entire text.
	       <div class="text">
	       This effect can be used while we try to hide some content.
	       </div>
	       <p>
	       As well, this effect can be mostly used  vendor-prefixing. I
	       have tested on Safari, Chrome and Firefox.However,this effect
	       does not show on my iPhone's safari.
