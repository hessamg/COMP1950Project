** please use server root based paths **

1.I changed the roots to /students/hganjian/... cause I thought its better if we all use server root based paths. 
since only one of us has to upload the final project on their page I used the hganjian(my own page). its ok if you want to change to Didi's 
or anyone else's. I simply didn't know her bcit path name.

2.I checked the excersize page and found there are 2 css paths that this page is using that do not exist.

3.I did the .inc path for the index.html so everyone can see how they can use it as a sample. you have to use wamp to be able to see it though

4.TRY to include only one css file unless its necessary.  if not just import it from in the css.
